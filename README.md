# Chopin AI

Ce programme est une intelligence artificielle qui a été créé afin d'imiter le style de Chopin en utilisant un Réseau neuronal Récurrent.

Note: le fichier rnn.py a été fait pour fonctionner dans Google Colab mais peut aussi fonctionner dans Jupyter.

EN:
This program is an AI that was created to imitate Chopin using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Note that the rnn.py file was made to work in Google Colab but can also work in Jupyter.

Content
This repositery contains a recurrent neural network (rnn) that was trained on Chopin's nocturnes. It also contains a program that parses midi files into strings of characters that are more easily understood by the rnn. 

Goal
The goal of this projet was to see if a recurrent neural network could go further than just creating music but also imitate the style of an artist. Chopin's nocturnes were selected because of their specific style that can be recognized easily and because of its use of a single instrument.
